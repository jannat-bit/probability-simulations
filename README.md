# 🎲 Probability Simulations in Python

This project explores fundamental concepts of probability and statistics using Python.  
It contains **Jupyter Notebook simulations** covering probability experiments, conditional probability, random variables, and the Central Limit Theorem — all with code and visualizations.

## 📌 Contents
1. **Coin Toss Simulation**  
   - Toss a coin 10,000 times  
   - Calculate experimental probability of heads and tails  

2. **Dice Roll Simulation**  
   - Roll two dice and compute probability of getting a sum of 7  

3. **At Least One Six**  
   - Estimate probability of rolling at least one "6" in 10 rolls of a fair die  

4. **Conditional Probability & Bayes’ Theorem**  
   - Bag with red, green, and blue balls  
   - Estimate conditional probability using simulations  
   - Verify Bayes’ theorem  

5. **Discrete Random Variables**  
   - Generate samples from a custom distribution  
   - Compute empirical mean, variance, and standard deviation  

6. **Exponential Distribution**  
   - Simulate random samples  
   - Plot histogram with probability density overlay  

7. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**  
   - Show how sample means approach a normal distribution

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (recommended)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook numpy matplotlib
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open probability_simulation.ipynb
Click Cell → Run All to run everything.
Option 2: VS Code
Install the Python and Jupyter extensions in VS Code
Open probability_simulation.ipynb
Select the correct Python kernel (e.g., Python 3.11 (Anaconda))
Click Run All
📊 Example Output
Coin toss results: probabilities close to 0.5 each
Dice simulation: probability of sum=7 ≈ 1/6
CLT visualization: sample means form a bell-shaped curve
🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.11+
Libraries:
numpy
